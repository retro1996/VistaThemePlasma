## Prerequisites <a name="preq"></a>

**NOTE**: Dependencies for other disros besides Arch Linux have been provided by contributors and aren't updated frequently, which may result in incorrect or missing dependencies.

### Arch Linux

Required packages:

```bash
pacman -S git cmake extra-cmake-modules ninja qt6-virtualkeyboard qt6-multimedia qt6-5compat plasma-wayland-protocols plasma5support kvantum base-devel
```

### Note:

Since Plasma 6.4, the X11 session has been separated from the main codebase. On Arch Linux, additional dependencies for X11 include:

- `kwin-x11`
- `plasma-x11-session`

KSysGuard has been officially deprecated by KDE, however an unofficial [port](https://github.com/zvova7890/ksysguard6) exists for Qt6, which can be installed using the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ksysguard6-git) package on Arch-based distros.

### Fedora KDE

## Getting started <a name="started"></a>

To download this repository, clone it with `git`: 

```bash
$ git clone https://gitgud.io/catpswin56/vistathemeplasma.git vistathemeplasma
$ cd vistathemeplasma
```

Whenever a new update is released, update the downloaded repository by pulling the new changes:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/vistathemeplasma
$ git pull
```

and re-run the install scripts:

```sh
$ sh compile.sh 
$ sh install_plasmoids.sh
$ sh install_plasmoids.sh --no-compile # If there's no need to recompile the C++ parts of the plasmoids, you can just run this
$ sh install_kwin_components.sh
$ sh install_plasma_components.sh
$ sh install_misc_components.sh # Usually not required to run again
```

Typically it's enough to run the first four scripts after VTP has been updated, although it's recommended to check new commits to see what has actually changed. 

When doing a full system upgrade, KWin effects and `libplasma` modifications tend to stop working. Running `compile.sh` after a full system upgrade is required for them to work again (assuming no breaking upstream changes).

## Compiling <a name="compile"></a>

To build the components that need to be compiled (KWin effects, Decoration theme, etc.), run `compile.sh`:

```bash
$ chmod +x compile.sh && ./compile.sh
```

or

```bash
$ sh compile.sh
```

You can additionally pass `--ninja` to any of the following scripts in order to build using Ninja, which is recommended to reduce build times:

- `compile.sh`
- `install_plasmoids.sh`
- Any individual `install.sh` script

Example: 

```bash
$ sh compile.sh --ninja
```

## Note for Wayland users:

The compile script must be run while passing the `--wayland` argument for KWin effects:

```bash
$ ./compile.sh --wayland --ninja
$ sh compile.sh --wayland --ninja # Or like this
```

If compiling individual KWin effects by running their respective `install.sh` scripts, you can also pass the `--wayland` argument there:

```bash
$ ./install.sh --wayland --ninja
$ sh install.sh --wayland --ninja # Or like this
```

## Plasma components <a name="plasma"></a>

This section relates to the directories found in the `plasma` folder.

### Install scripts

1. Run the following scripts:

```bash
$ chmod +x install_plasmoids.sh && ./install_plasmoids.sh --ninja
$ chmod +x install_plasma_components.sh && ./install_plasma_components.sh # Requires authorization for SMOD resources and SDDM themes
```

### Note for VistaTasks:

VistaTasks relies on modifications found in `misc/defaulttooltip` in order to work properly. Make sure that they're compiled and installed correctly before enabling VistaTasks.

### Manual

1. Move the `smod` folder to `~/.local/share`, or `/usr/share/` for a system-wide installation. This will install the resources required by many other components in this project.

2. Move the folders `desktoptheme`, `look-and-feel`, `plasmoids`, `layout-templates`, `shells` into `~/.local/share/plasma`. If the folder doesn't exist, create it. These folders contain the following:

    - Plasma Style
    - Global Theme
    - Plasmoids
    - Plasma shell
    - Preset panel layout that can be applied from Edit mode
    
3. Move `sddm-theme-mod` to `/usr/share/sddm/themes`. This will install the SDDM theme.

## KWin components <a name="kwin"></a>

### Install scripts

1. Run the following script:

```bash
$ chmod +x install_kwin_components.sh && ./install_kwin_components.sh 
```

### Manual 

This section relates to the directories found in the `kwin` folder.

1. Move `effects`, `tabbox`, `outline`, `scripts` to `~/.local/share/kwin`.
2. Run the following inside `~/.local/share/`:

```bash
$ ln -s kwin kwin-x11
$ ln -s kwin kwin-wayland
```

3. In System Settings, apply the following settings:

- In Window Behavior -> Titlebar Actions:
  - Mouse wheel: Do nothing
- In Window Behavior -> Task Switcher:
  - Main: Thumbnail Seven, Include "Show Desktop" entry
  - Alternative: Flip Switch, Forward shortcut: Meta+Tab
- In Window Behavior -> Desktop Effects, enable the following:
  - Aero Glass Blur
  - Desaturate Unresponsive Applications
  - SMOD Glow
  - SMOD Snap
  - Dim Screen for Administrator Mode
- In Window Behavior -> Desktop Effects, **disable** the following:
  - Background Contrast
  - Blur
  - Maximize
  - Dialog Parent
  - Dim Inactive
  
4. Configure KWin animations to the following:

![animations](screenshots/animations.png)


## Miscellaneous components <a name="misc"></a>

### Install scripts

1. Run the following script:

```bash
$ chmod +x install_misc_components.sh && ./install_misc_components.sh
```

This section relates to the directories found in the `misc` folder.

1. Move the `Kvantum` folder (the one inside the `kvantum` folder) to `~/.config`, then in Kvantum Manager select the theme.
2. Unpack the sound archive and move the folders to `~/.local/share/sounds`, then select the sound theme in System Settings.
3. Unpack the icon archive and move the folder to `~/.local/share/icons`, then select the icon theme in System Settings.
4. Unpack the cursor archive and move the folder to `/usr/share/icons`, then follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj7co2R7RKw) guide to install the cursor theme.
5. Move the files located in `mimetype` into `~/.local/share/mime/packages` and then run `update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime` to fix DLLs and EXE files sharing the same icons.
6. Segoe UI, Segoe UI Bold, Segoe UI Semibold and Segoe UI Italic are required for this theme and they should be installed as system-wide fonts.

If SDDM fails to pick up on the cursor theme, go to System Settings -> Startup and Shutdown -> Login Screen (SDDM), and click on Apply Plasma Settings to enforce your current cursor theme, and other relevant settings. Do this _after_ installing everything else. If even that fails, change the default cursor theme in `/usr/share/icons/default/index.theme` to say `aero-drop`.

### Plymouth theme

Optionally, install [PlymouthVista](https://github.com/furkrn/PlymouthVista) which supports Windows Vista boot animations, and features a more detailed setup guide.

## Configuring VistaThemePlasma <a name="conf"></a>

1. Apply the Global Theme after installing everything. Make sure to restart KDE Plasma and KWin as well, by restarting your session.
2. On a fresh KDE install, **remove** the default panel and add the "VistaThemePlasma Taskbar" panel using Edit mode. You can also manually configure the panel for a finer setup.
3. Right click on the desktop and open "Desktop and Wallpaper", and select "Vista Desktop" under Layout, and apply the changes.
4. Disable the following entries in the system tray settings:

   - Power and Battery
   - Networks
   - Keyboard Layout
   - Audio Volume

   And enable the following entries:

   - Battery
   - Network Management
   - Volume Mixer

5. When updating KDE Plasma, usually through a full system upgrade, recompiling KWin effects and the DefaultToolTip component is necessary.
6. In System Settings -> Colors & Themes -> Colors, set "Accent color from color scheme"
7. In System Settings -> Session -> Desktop Session, uncheck the "Ask for confirmation" option.
8. In System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts, under KWin, disable the "Peek at Desktop" shortcut, and remap the "MinimizeAll" to Meta+D
9. In System Settings -> Colors & Themes -> Cursors -> Configure Launch Feedback, set Cursor feedback to "None"
10. In System Settings -> Fonts, configure the fonts as shown here:

![fontconfig](screenshots/fontconfig.png)

11. To add the gadgets sidebar, drag and drop the "Windows Sidebar" plasmoid from the "Add Widgets" menu into the desktop.

The following steps are optional: 

12. To enable full font hinting just for Segoe UI, move the ```fontconfig``` folder to ```~/.config```. This will enable full font hinting for Segoe UI while keeping slight font hinting for other fonts. Additionally, append ```QML_DISABLE_DISTANCEFIELD=1``` into ```/etc/environment``` in order for this to be properly applied. *While full font hinting makes the font rendering look sharper and somewhat closer to Windows 7's ClearType, on Linux this option causes noticeably faulty kerning. This has been a [prominent](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues/11765) [issue](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pango/-/issues/656) [for](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pango/-/issues/463) [several](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pango/-/issues/404) [years](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/issues/2394) [now](https://www.phoronix.com/news/HarfBuzz-Hinting-Woe) and while the situation has improved from being unreadable to just being ugly, a complete solution for this doesn't seem to be coming anytime soon.*
13. For Wine users it's recommended to install the [VistaVG Ultimate](https://www.deviantart.com/vishal-gupta/art/VistaVG-Ultimate-57715902) msstyles theme.
14. Add the following to ```~/.bashrc``` to get bash to look more like the command prompt on Windows:

```
PS1='C:${PWD//\//\\\\}> '

echo -e "Microsoft Windows [Version 6.0.6003]\nCopyright (c) 2006 Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.\n"
```

15. In the terminal emulator of your choice (e.g Konsole), set the font to [TerminalVector](https://www.yohng.com/software/terminalvector.html), size 9pt. Disable smooth font rendering and bold text, reduce the line spacing and margins to 0px, set the cursor shape to underline, and enable cursor blinking.

## Extras <a name="extras"></a>

This section relates to the directories found inside the ``extras`` folder and is completely optional.

### Extra components

**ExecBin**

Moved to [another repository](https://gitgud.io/catpswin56/execbin)

**UAC-like Polkit agent** 

# WARNING:

## Installing random modifications to programs that deal with privilege escalation (giving sudo or root access to users) from unknown or untrustworthy sources is reckless and a giant security risk. Even though this modification to KDE's polkit authentication UI is purely cosmetic (and even hotfixes a [longstanding](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=448554) [issue](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=502763)), it's generally not recommended to modify sensitive applications such as this. If you don't know what you're doing, or do not trust the modified source code, do not install this particular component of VistaThemePlasma.

KDE Polkit Agent modification to make it look more like Windows' UAC dialog.

![uac-polkitagent](screenshots/uac-polkitagent.png)

**Installation**

1. Navigate to the ```uac-polkitagent``` folder, and run ```install.sh``` (or ```install_ninja.sh``` if you have Ninja installed):

```bash
$ chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

2. To remove the minimize and maximize buttons from the window, run ```add_rule.sh``` which will generate the appropriate KWin rule: 

```bash
$ chmod +x add_rule.sh && ./add_rule.sh
```
