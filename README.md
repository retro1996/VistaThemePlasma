## Introduction

This is a fork of WackyIdeas' [AeroThemePlasma](https://gitgud.io/wackyideas/aerothemeplasma) which aims to recreate the look and feel of Windows Vista as much as possible on KDE Plasma, whilst adapting the design to fit in with modern features provided by KDE Plasma and Linux.
It is still in heavy development and testing. VTP has been tested on:

1. Arch Linux x64 and other Arch derivatives, KDE Neon
2. Plasma 6.2.4, KDE Frameworks 6.8.0, Qt 6.8.0
3. 96 DPI scaling, single monitor

See [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for a quick, almost unmodified ATP install guide.
